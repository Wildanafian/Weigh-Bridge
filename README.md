# Weigh Bridge

This is a simple Android app to record inbound and outbound truck weights. Some of the technologies used in this project are listed below:

* Language: Kotlin
* Dependency Injection: Hilt
* Design Pattern: MVVM & Clean Architecture
* Sync / Async Task: Kotlin Coroutine
* Reactive Programming: LiveData & Kotlin Flow
* Storage: Room Database & Firebase Realtime Database
* Unit Testing: MockK, Turbine

The app contains three main screens (Front Page, Add New Ticket, and Edit Ticket). On the front page, users can see the list of tickets. When a user taps a ticket, a bottom sheet dialog will appear, allowing the user to view the ticket details, edit the ticket, or delete the ticket.

Users can add a new ticket by tapping the floating button at the corner of the screen. Users can also perform basic ticket sorting and filtering by tapping the filter and sort menu at the bottom of the screen.

Here are some screenshots of the app:
